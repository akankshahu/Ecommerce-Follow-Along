## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the backend for our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized the backend code into dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
- **Server Setup**: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests and listen on a designated port.
- **Database Connection**: Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling to provide clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

This setup ensures that our backend is well-structured and ready to support the application as it grows.

## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

In this milestone, we focused on enhancing the backend of our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **User Model**: Created a User Model to define how user data is stored in the database.
- **User Controller**: Developed a User Controller to manage user-related operations such as adding a new user and retrieving user information.
- **File Uploads with Multer**: Set up Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload profile images.

This setup ensures that our backend can efficiently manage user data and handle file uploads.

## Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page

## Objective of Milestone 5:

In this milestone, the primary goal was to create the Sign-Up page for the application. The page allows users to input their details, register for an account, and submit that data to the server. We‚Äôve built a front-end form that includes input fields for Name, Email, and Password, and added form validation to ensure the submitted data is correct and meets basic requirements.

## What Was Accomplished:

Created a Sign-Up Form (Frontend - HTML & CSS):
The Sign-Up form includes three main fields for the user to input data:
Name: The user's full name.
Email: The user‚Äôs email address.
Password: The user‚Äôs password for the account.
Each field is paired with a label, making the form e
asy to understand and accessible for all users.
Form Validation (JavaScript):
Form validation ensures that the data entered by the user meets the expected format before being submitted to the backend.
The form fields are validated for the following criteria:
Name Field: Ensures that the name is not left blank and has a value.
Email Field: Ensures that the email entered is in a valid email format (e.g., example@domain.com).
Password Field: Checks that the password entered meets the minimum length requirement (6 characters or more).

## Milestone 6: What was achieved

- **Password Encryption**: Implemented bcrypt to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Secure User Data Storage**: Created a backend signup route that stores user data (name, email) in MongoDB, ensuring the password is encrypted and never stored in plain text.
- **Database Setup**: Configured MongoDB and Mongoose to store user data securely.

## User Signup & Password Encryption

### What was achieved:

- Created a backend API for user signup.
- Integrated bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- Ensured all user data (name, email, etc.) is stored securely, with passwords never stored in plain text.

### Instructions:

- To start the server, use `npm start`.
- Make a POST request to `/signup` with the following body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }
  ```
  # Milestone 7 - User Login Implementation

In this milestone, I have implemented the user login functionality for the backend. The steps taken are:

1. **Login Endpoint**: I created a POST endpoint `/login` that accepts user credentials (email and password).
2. **Password Validation**: I used `bcrypt` to compare the hashed password stored in the database with the user's input.
3. **Error Handling**: If the user doesn't exist or the password is incorrect, appropriate error messages are returned.
4. **Success**: If the login is successful, a message is returned indicating a successful login.

This milestone helps ensure that sensitive information (like passwords) is securely hashed and compared, adding an important layer of security to the application.

### Next Steps:

In the next milestone, I will focus on enhancing the security of the login process by implementing sessions or JWT for user authentication.

# Milestone 8 - Product Card Component

In this milestone, I created a reusable product card component and displayed multiple product cards on the homepage.

### Achievements:

1. **Card Component**: A card component was created to display product information such as name, price, and image.
2. **Dynamic Data**: The homepage was updated to dynamically display multiple product cards using an array of product data.
3. **Grid Layout**: A responsive grid layout was applied to neatly organize the product cards.
4. **Reusable Design**: The card component is designed to be reusable for various products.

### Next Steps:

In the next milestone, I plan to add features like product filtering, sorting, and integrating the API to fetch products dynamically.

## Milestone 9: Product Form Creation

## Overview

In Milestone 9, we focus on creating a frontend form to handle product details input. This form will allow users to submit multiple images, product information, and store these details for future use in the database. The final product will be displayed on the products home page, which was created in the previous milestone.

       !!! Learning Goals üéØ !!!

By the end of this milestone, you will:

1> Learn how to create a form that accepts all product details (like name, description, price, etc.).

2> Learn how to handle the submission of multiple images for a product.

3> Understand how to integrate this form with a backend (for example, with a Mongoose schema).

4>Gain experience in implementing user input and managing files in a frontend project.

### Why Create Product Form?

The product form serves as the input interface for adding new products to the ecommerce platform. Without this form, there would be no way to add products to the system. The form will accept various details for each product such as:

Product Name: The name of the product.
Description: A brief description of the product.
Price: The price of the product.
Images: Multiple images representing the product (for display purposes).
These details will eventually be saved in the database and displayed on the product homepage, which was set up in the previous milestone.

#### Steps Taken in Milestone 9 üìù

1. Create the Product Form
   The core functionality of Milestone 9 revolves around creating a form where users can input all the necessary details about a product. This includes text inputs for product name, price, and description, along with an option to upload multiple images. The form uses the multipart/form-data format to send files (images) to the backend.

Features of the Form:
Product Name: A text input field for entering the product's name.
Description: A textarea for entering a detailed description of the product.
Price: A number input for the price of the product.
Images: An input field that allows multiple images to be uploaded at once. 2. Handling Multiple Images
To support multiple image uploads, we utilized an input field with the attribute multiple, which allows the user to select more than one file. These files are then sent to the backend for processing and storage. The backend will store the images and their metadata, which will be linked to the corresponding product in the database.

3. Mongoose Schema for Products
   We created a Mongoose schema to define the structure of the product object that will be saved in the database. The schema includes the following fields:

name: String - Name of the product.
description: String - Description of the product.
price: Number - Price of the product.
images: Array - List of image URLs related to the product (these images are uploaded and stored in a cloud storage solution). 4. Backend Integration
We set up an API endpoint to handle the form submission, which saves the product details in the database and stores the images. This backend API processes the uploaded images and stores their URLs in the database.

5. Admin Access (Optional)
   For future improvements, we discussed how to extend this functionality to allow only admins to upload products. This involves implementing authentication and authorization, ensuring that only users with admin privileges can add new products.

$$ Future Improvements üí° $$
As the project continues to evolve, we suggest several potential enhancements to build on Milestone 9:

Admin Authentication: Implement an admin role to restrict product uploads to administrators only.
User Profiles: Allow users to create and maintain shop profiles, where they can upload and manage their products.
Product Validation: Add validation on the backend to ensure that product names, prices, and images are valid before saving to the database.
Product Search and Sorting: In future milestones, we will enhance the product homepage by adding features like filtering and sorting of products based on categories, price range, etc.

## Milestone 10: Product Schema and Endpoint Creation

### What was achieved in this milestone:

In Milestone 10, the following tasks were completed:

1. **Mongoose Product Schema Creation:**

   - Defined the structure of the product data using Mongoose.
   - Included fields like `name`, `description`, `price`, and `image URL`.
   - Implemented validation for each field to ensure only valid data is saved to the database.

2. **POST Endpoint for Storing Product Data:**

   - Built a POST endpoint that accepts product data.
   - Validated the incoming data and stored it in the MongoDB database.
   - Ensured proper error handling and response messages in case of invalid data.

3. **Validation:**
   - Ensured that only valid product data is saved to the database by adding validation rules for fields like `name`, `description`, `price`, and `image URL`.

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Product Schema**: Used Mongoose to create the schema with proper data types and validation.
- **POST Endpoint**: Created an endpoint to receive product details and store them in the database.
- **Validation**: Ensured that data such as `name` and `price` are required, and that the `image URL` is in a valid format.

### Additional Improvements:

- This milestone provides the foundation for creating an admin access system, allowing only admins to upload products.
- It also sets up the basic framework for a user shop profile, which can be expanded later on.

### How to Test:

- Run the application locally or in your preferred environment.
- Use Postman or any API testing tool to send a POST request to `/products` with the following sample JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product Description",
  "price": 19.99,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
```
