# Ecommerce-Follow-Along.

Building an e-commerce app using the MERN stack.
This is a full-fledged e-commerce application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The goal of this project is to learn how to build and deploy a real-world application with the MERN stack, focusing on key features like authentication, product management, and order handling.

## Milestone 2: Project Overview

Milestone 2:

Welcome to the Follow-Along Project: Milestone 2! üöÄ

In this Milestone 2, we‚Äôll structure the project, set up the frontend and backend, and build the login page for application.

This milestone focuses on creating the project structure, configuring tools, and starting with your first user-facing feature - the Login Page.

Create a structured folder hierarchy for the project.
Set up a React app for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.
Configure Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
Add optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
Build a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

Key features of milestone 2 üõ†Ô∏è

Project Folder Structure: Learn to organize your project files into separate frontend and backend directories.

React Frontend Setup: Initialized a React application for building the user interface.

Node.js Backend Setup: Set up a simple Node.js server to prepare for API integration in future milestones.

Login Page Development: Create the first user interface of your e-commerce application, focusing on both functionality and styling.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the backend for our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized the backend code into dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
- **Server Setup**: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests and listen on a designated port.
- **Database Connection**: Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling to provide clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

This setup ensures that our backend is well-structured and ready to support the application as it grows.

## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

In this milestone, we focused on enhancing the backend of our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **User Model**: Created a User Model to define how user data is stored in the database.
- **User Controller**: Developed a User Controller to manage user-related operations such as adding a new user and retrieving user information.
- **File Uploads with Multer**: Set up Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload profile images.

This setup ensures that our backend can efficiently manage user data and handle file uploads.
