# Ecommerce-Follow-Along.

Building an e-commerce app using the MERN stack.
This is a full-fledged e-commerce application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The goal of this project is to learn how to build and deploy a real-world application with the MERN stack, focusing on key features like authentication, product management, and order handling.

## Milestone 2: Project Overview

Milestone 2:

Welcome to the Follow-Along Project: Milestone 2! üöÄ

In this Milestone 2, we‚Äôll structure the project, set up the frontend and backend, and build the login page for application.

This milestone focuses on creating the project structure, configuring tools, and starting with your first user-facing feature - the Login Page.

Create a structured folder hierarchy for the project.
Set up a React app for the frontend and a Node.js server for the backend.
Configure Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
Add optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
Build a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

Key features of milestone 2 üõ†Ô∏è

Project Folder Structure: Learn to organize your project files into separate frontend and backend directories.

React Frontend Setup: Initialized a React application for building the user interface.

Node.js Backend Setup: Set up a simple Node.js server to prepare for API integration in future milestones.

Login Page Development: Create the first user interface of your e-commerce application, focusing on both functionality and styling.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the backend for our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **Backend Folder Structure**: Organized the backend code into dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
- **Server Setup**: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests and listen on a designated port.
- **Database Connection**: Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and confirmed the connection between the server and MongoDB.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling to provide clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.

This setup ensures that our backend is well-structured and ready to support the application as it grows.

## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

In this milestone, we focused on enhancing the backend of our e-commerce application. The key achievements include:

- **User Model**: Created a User Model to define how user data is stored in the database.
- **User Controller**: Developed a User Controller to manage user-related operations such as adding a new user and retrieving user information.
- **File Uploads with Multer**: Set up Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload profile images.

This setup ensures that our backend can efficiently manage user data and handle file uploads.

## Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page

## Objective of Milestone 5:

In this milestone, the primary goal was to create the Sign-Up page for the application. The page allows users to input their details, register for an account, and submit that data to the server. We‚Äôve built a front-end form that includes input fields for Name, Email, and Password, and added form validation to ensure the submitted data is correct and meets basic requirements.

## What Was Accomplished:

Created a Sign-Up Form (Frontend - HTML & CSS):
The Sign-Up form includes three main fields for the user to input data:
Name: The user's full name.
Email: The user‚Äôs email address.
Password: The user‚Äôs password for the account.
Each field is paired with a label, making the form e
asy to understand and accessible for all users.
Form Validation (JavaScript):
Form validation ensures that the data entered by the user meets the expected format before being submitted to the backend.
The form fields are validated for the following criteria:
Name Field: Ensures that the name is not left blank and has a value.
Email Field: Ensures that the email entered is in a valid email format (e.g., example@domain.com).
Password Field: Checks that the password entered meets the minimum length requirement (6 characters or more).

## Milestone 6: What was achieved

- **Password Encryption**: Implemented bcrypt to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Secure User Data Storage**: Created a backend signup route that stores user data (name, email) in MongoDB, ensuring the password is encrypted and never stored in plain text.
- **Database Setup**: Configured MongoDB and Mongoose to store user data securely.

## User Signup & Password Encryption

### What was achieved:

- Created a backend API for user signup.
- Integrated bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- Ensured all user data (name, email, etc.) is stored securely, with passwords never stored in plain text.

### Instructions:

- To start the server, use `npm start`.
- Make a POST request to `/signup` with the following body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }
  ```
  # Milestone 7 - User Login Implementation

In this milestone, I have implemented the user login functionality for the backend. The steps taken are:

1. **Login Endpoint**: I created a POST endpoint `/login` that accepts user credentials (email and password).
2. **Password Validation**: I used `bcrypt` to compare the hashed password stored in the database with the user's input.
3. **Error Handling**: If the user doesn't exist or the password is incorrect, appropriate error messages are returned.
4. **Success**: If the login is successful, a message is returned indicating a successful login.

This milestone helps ensure that sensitive information (like passwords) is securely hashed and compared, adding an important layer of security to the application.

### Next Steps:

In the next milestone, I will focus on enhancing the security of the login process by implementing sessions or JWT for user authentication.

# Milestone 8 - Product Card Component

In this milestone, I created a reusable product card component and displayed multiple product cards on the homepage.

### Achievements:

1. **Card Component**: A card component was created to display product information such as name, price, and image.
2. **Dynamic Data**: The homepage was updated to dynamically display multiple product cards using an array of product data.
3. **Grid Layout**: A responsive grid layout was applied to neatly organize the product cards.
4. **Reusable Design**: The card component is designed to be reusable for various products.

### Next Steps:

In the next milestone, I plan to add features like product filtering, sorting, and integrating the API to fetch products dynamically.
